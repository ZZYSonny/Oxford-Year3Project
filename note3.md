- (I found a better grammar checker inside my latex editor. The last one only checks for spelling mistakes :)
- ABC Spec only 
- I found why my implementation for TerminatingQueue was slow
  - In my old implementation, I have `if (y==0) then div else` as an assertion for CSP to avoid considering these cases at compile stage. (For example, waiting should always >0 when `waiting-=1`)
  - When I move the assertion to `getValue?y:{1..NThread}`, the system has fewer states and transitions. No difference between the systems.
  - With the old implementation, FDR builds unnecessary transitions when one thread diverges, which results in even more unnecessary transitions when other threads are running.
- Implemented LP Test for Exchanger
  - There are a few observed advantages of explicit LP testing
    - The Spec process is simpler and has fewer states and transitions. (Linear to number of thread)
    - Reduce state and transition for the system. Call/Return events are more complicated than P1/P1'/P2. The first can occur like (Call, Call, Return, Return), or (Call, Return, Call, Return). The second always happen like (P1,P1',P2, then another new round), at least for this object.
    - Comparing is faster. (Small [T= Big is faster than Big [T= Big). You can run `assert Spec [T= System({T1,T2,T3,T4,T5})` and assert `System({T1,T2,T3,T4,T5}) [T= System({T1,T2,T3,T4,T5})`
  - But states and transitions of the system still grow exponentially with the number of threads. 
- LP Test
  - Return value of a function needs to be checked by hand. 
  - Instead of renaming, I think it is equivalent to have LP event after setting the value of the queue. 
    - For (single) monitor-based object, there is at most one thread running at the same time. 
    - For (single) semaphore-based object, when one thread updates some value, another thread needs to be synchronized to get the updated value. If the implementation is correct, then another thread should not read the updated value before the LP event (raise semaphore). If someone forgets about this, this can be captured by P2->P1->P1'.123
- LP Test for Terminating Queue
  - If we consider `waiting` as a linearization point, we can probably use it to check deadlock freedom. Once a thread does `VarWaiting::setValue!N`, then all other threads should do `VarWaiting::setValue!(-=1)`
- Feature
```
Call.T1.A (wait at 25, deadlock) 
                                              Call.T2.A (wait at 25, deadlock)
          Call.T3.IsA (finishes) Return T3.A
```
  - The linearizer does not see LP of T1, and T2. So it cannot say it is an illegal trace.
  - Deadlock free test
    - T1 and T2 can be waked up with Spurious wakeup and perform some events.
    - Even when spurious wakeup is disabled in the monitor, the system does not fail a deadlock-free test. Because T3 can receive again and release one of the threads. 
```
Call.T1.A
                                  Call.T2.A                          Return.T2.A
          Call.T3.IsA Return.T3.A            Call.T3.IsA Return.T3.A
```
    - Explicit LP should be able to find this feature.

- Timeout Channel
  - For (infinity time) implementation, the thread uses time to check if the operation timeouts. Maybe it is easier to have a separated process to receive `duration` number of tock event, and then set a timeout variable the thread can read? Or is it changing too much code?
```
sendWithin(me,x,duration)=(
  --set variable timeout to true
  Monitor::enter(me)
  --in while loop, check timeout variable
) ||| (
  runENtime(tock, duration) ->
  --set variable timeout to false
)
```


```
returnNone can replace ReturnNone
replace DIV with error.me
[[ setValue.1 <- setValue.1, setValue.1 <- P1.t.datasend | ... ]]
System State exploding - symmetry reduction
To check return answer
- check by hand
- add return event, and check spec, return and P1P1' matches.
